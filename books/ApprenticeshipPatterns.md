## Why Am I Reading This Book?

VGW LnD.

To learn how to operate within a professional environment, ask the right questions and continue to grow as a software craftsman.

This will become a repisotry to refer to when I am *feelinga certain way, and can refer to the feeling in the tagline of a pattern, address the feeling and come to a solution based on my notes here.

## Notes

***What is software Craftsmanship?***

- Having a mentor helps us grow

- Can get stuck in habits when switching languages

- Feedback is vital to learn, and should be taken on.

- "The willingness to recognize the inadequacies in what you do and to seek out solutions"

- Share Knowledge
    - Reinforces your own knowledge (skill shares)

- Willingness to experiment and be willing to be proven wrong

- Try. Fail. Use the lessons

***What does it mean to be an apprentice?***

Cement the idea that there's always a better way to do what you are doing.
The outcome of my apprenticeship is in my control.
Always be learning.

### Expose your Ignorance
**Context:**
The 
**Problem:**
Maybe you know how to accomplish the task partially. Yet your colleagues need confidence that you can deliver.

**Solution:**
"The learning process is part of delivering software."
Tell people the truth. Let them know htat you're starting to understand what they want and you're in the process of learning how to give it to them. If you reassure them, reassure them with your ability to learn, not by pretyending to know something you don't. In this way, your reputation will be built upon your learning ability rather that what you already know.
While you're exposing your ignorance, you're also exposing your learning ability.
"Like bare patches in a garden, ignorance can be redued by cultivation your seeds of knowledge. Water your seeds through experimentaion, practice, and reading. You can choose to hide these bare patchers from the light, embarrassed by their size, covering them to keep your pride intact. Or you can choose to expose them, being honest with yourself and the people who are depending on you, and asking for help"

Pick something that you know really well and reimplement it.

---

### The Long Road
**Context:**
There's a new wave of developers, and we seem to be making the same mistakes from the beginning of ages. 

**Problem:**
You want to become a better developer, yet conventional wisdom tells you to take the highest-paying job and the first promotion available. 
Becoming a master takes time. 

**Solution:**
Value learning and long term growth opportunities over salary. 
Set goals and work torwards that goal. We become what we do today.

---

### Craft over Art
**Context:**
You're being paid to program

**Problem**
The problem will be challenging enough to exercise your problem solving skills.

**Solution**

Though you must develop your technical skills, you will often find yourself in the realities of 
customers shifting and conflicting demands.

**Problem**
Working in real world projects takes a lot of effort(it's sometimes tedious, exhausting, and frustrating). 

**Solution**
Find what keeps you going. Though the money may be good, it is better to value education and experience. Where you can make
a difference and make useful things. Contribute to open source and be the best version of yourself in developing programs. 
*Do what you what you love and the money will follow*

**Action**
Write down 5 things that motivate you. 

---

### Nurture Your Passion

### Stay in the Trenches
**Context**
You're able to deliver software due to your effort and dedication.

**Problem**
You're given a job that will pull you away from programming.

**Solution**
The more days you go without practicing programming the longer it will take you to become a master at it.
A promotion to management may not be what you want. 

**Action**
Negotiate with your employer when that reward (promotion) comes. In case you want to stay in the trenches.

If not software development, then what would you do? write it down, talk to people who are doing it 
and ask them what they love about it and compare it with programming. 

---

### Be The Worst
**Context**
You have *Unleashed Your Enthusiasmand have outgrown your team.

**Problem**
Your rate of learning has leveled off.

**Solution**
Surround yourself with talented people. As you build *Breakable Toysyou can
test how much you've been picking up from *Rubbing Elbowswith them.
By being the worst in the team doesn't mean you're not doing you're job,
it means you're putting your most effort and energy at getting better at the craft.
You don't want to slow down your team and/or put your job in jeopardy.

**Action**
List all the teams you know. Include open source projects,
other departments, and other companies. Sort these teams by skill level,
then identify a team that is open to new members who want to work their way up.
This will give you an idea of your skill level.

Reach out to someone you admire, see if you can meet atleast once a month.
This will give you a head start in what you need to do next.

**Action**
Pick a tool, library, or a community that has an active mailing list.
Sign up to the list, but don't post any messages yet.
Just observe who is patient in responding to the questions.
When the next meetup or conference happens, try to connect with them,
and ask for informal advices they've learned. 

---

### Kindred Spirits
**Context**
You find yourself discouraged by the cultured of your development organization.

**Problem**
Organizational cultures that encourages software craftsmaship are rare. You find yourself stranded without mentors.

---

### Practice, Practice, Practice

**Context**
You want to get better at things and to develop Concrete Skills in those areas.

**Problem**
You're not given the room to experiment and try things,
(even if you're completely wrong, you want to prove it to yourself why).

**Solution**
Take the time to practice without any interruptions, in an environment where you can feel comfortable making mistakes.

**Action**
Find an exercise in one of these books (Programming Pearls,
More Programming Pearls, Etudes for Programmers), and create one of your own.

---

**Action**
Find something fun you'd like to build and spend some time working on it.

---

### Use the Source

**Context**
We find the source of truth by reading the source code of someone's program,
not by talking to them in an attempt to get their intentions.

**Problem**
You may not have people to proofread your work and give you feedback.
You may not be reading enough source code to know that yours need improvement.

**Solution**
Be able to read source code and understand what it does.

**Action**
Pick an algorithmically sophisticated open source project and browse it's source code.
Write a blog post about it, identifying the algorithm, data structures, and design ideas that are new to you.

---

### Reflect As You Work
*Self-examination is hard, but I believe we can learn more from studying our failures than from our successes.*

**Context**
You may be promoted, but not be prepared based on your skill level.

**Problem**
As the number of years and projects you have under your belt increases,
you find yourself awaiting the epiphany that will magically make you "experienced."

**Solution**
Become skilled rather than experienced.

**Action**
Draw a Personal Practices Map for your working habits.
Concentrate on the connections between any practices that have not changed in a while.
Ask yourself how your map would change if you discovered that one of
those practices was actually counterproductive. Closely examine one of those
practices and find out if there are other ways to achieve the same goal.
These don’t have to be better ways; it’s enough for them to be different.
Now ask yourself what would happen to your map if you were to adopt one of these different practices.

---

### Record What You Learn
**Context**
You keep doing things repeatedly, but the details escape you.

**Problem**
You do not learn from you past.

**Solution**
Keep a journal or a blog. Where you keep record of what you learned.
But don't just write down things and learn it there; revise your material often, making sure that the data is up-to-date.
You could have two journals a private one where you're more honest and open, and a public one where you're more comfortable
sharing the things you struggled with and their outcomes.

**Action**
Grab a notebook, and start jotting down your thoughts about these topics and the ideas that come to your mind.
In the future they might become a blog post, an article, or even a book.

---

### Share What You Learn
**Context**
You have been an apprentice for a little while and people have started to look to you as a source of knowledge.

**Problem**
Up until now you have been focusing on your self improvement.
To become a skilled developer you'll need the ability to communicate effectively and bring other people up to speed quickly.

**Solution**
Try sharing the lessons you have learned.
If possible prepare a presentation.
  This doesn't have to be on an in depth talk.
  Depending on the subject you could try to simplify it as much as possible to make it friendly.
"*When one person teaches, two people learn.*"

**Action**
Think back to the last significant lesson you learned. Write a blog post about it.
Provide the information you wish had existed and that would have helped you learn.

Having written the blog post, imagine you’re being asked to prepare a workshop
for a conference that will teach other people the same lesson.
Sketch out that workshop. See if the act of thinking about how you would
teach others in an engaging way causes you to rethink the lesson and the blog post.

---

### Create Feedback Loop
**Context**
It's hard to evaluate yourself. Success or failure tends to come as a surprise to you.
When you receive some sort of feedback, instead of good it does more damage to your self-assessment.

**Problem**
It will be difficult to have a self-assessment based on your team, as the skill level of your team mates may vary.

**Solution**
Try gathering some sort of objective data about your performance sooner than later.
Pair programming. 


**Action**
Find something in your working environment that you can measure and,
more importantly, affect. Track that metric for a while. As it changes,
ask yourself what it’s telling you about your world.
See if you can use it (and other metrics) to understand the effects
of the changes you are making to your working environment.

---

### Learn How You Fail
**Context**
Failure is inevitable.
In fact, someone who has never failed at anything has either avoided pushing
at the boundaries of their abilities or has learned to overlook their own mistakes.

**Problem**
You learning skill shave enhanced your successes, but your failures and weaknesses remain.

**Solution**
This is not about wallowing in self-pity about past mistakes nor is it an exercise in seeking perfection.
Instead, the goal is to gain self-knowledge about the patterns, conditions, habits,
and behaviors that lead you to failure. Armed with that self-knowledge,
you can make conscious choices and temper the tendency toward idealism when applying
Draw Your Own Map with an awareness of your boundaries and limitations.

**Action**

Write solutions to problems, and tests you think you need. After running note down where you failed and why. Repeat

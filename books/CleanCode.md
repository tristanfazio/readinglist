## Why Am I Reading This Book?

- VGW Associate reading list requirement
- Addiotionally, I don't just want to be a developer that can write code. I want to make this career into a craft. Something I can be proud of. This book sounds like it has a good framing, on how to be a professional in this field, and how to tend for and hone the craft of software engineering, so I am actually somewhat excited to read this book

-quote by *Michael Feathers*
>I could list all the qualities that i notice in clean code, but there is one overarching quality that leads to all of them. Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares. There is nothing more you can do to make it better... code left by by someone who cares deeply about the craft.

This quote resonated deeply with me.
